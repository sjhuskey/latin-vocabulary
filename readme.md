I made this repository for the purpose of merging two sets of information about Latin vocabulary. I wanted to have a list of all of the vocabularly used in [_Wheelock's Latin_](http://www.wheelockslatin.com/) that also showed the ranking of each word in terms of usage frequency as recorded in [Dickinson College Commentaries' Latin Core Vocabulary list](https://dcc.dickinson.edu/latin-core-list1).

I used the helpful [Google Doc of all of the vocabulary in Wheelock](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_exhKRH1rVIL2yE_dc8jLk6zPwsb-r4os-BX43k6RE/edit?usp=sharing) to get the list of words. DCC thoughtfully makes their Latin Core Vocabulary list available for free as a CSV (bene factum, DCC!). I did some preprocessing of the two sets of information to get two sets of data that I could compare. After that, I used the Python [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to merge the two sets. Overkill? Definitely! But it beats doing the comparison manually!
